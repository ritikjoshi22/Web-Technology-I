            Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) was created on August 16, 1985
            (Bhadra 1, 2042) under the Nepal Electricity Authority Act. 1984,
            through the merger of the Department of Electricity of Ministry of
            Water Resources, Nepal Electricity Corporation and related
            Development Boards. <br />
            To remedy the inherent weakness associated with these fragmented
            electricity organizations with overlapping and duplication of works,
            merger of this individual organisation became necessary to achieve
            efficiency and reliable service. <br />

            The primary objective of NEA is to generate, transmit and distribute
            adequate, reliable and affordable power by planning, constructing,
            operating and maintaining all generation, transmission and
            distribution facilities in Nepal's power system both interconnected
            and isolated. <br />
            <strong>
              In addition to achieving above primary objective, NEA's major
              responsibilities are:</strong
