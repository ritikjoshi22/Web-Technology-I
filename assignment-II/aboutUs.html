            <h2>Introducing NEA</h2>
            <p>
              Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) was created on August 16, 1985
              (Bhadra 1, 2042) under the Nepal Electricity Authority Act. 1984,
              through the merger of the Department of Electricity of Ministry of
              Water Resources, Nepal Electricity Corporation and related
              Development Boards. To remedy the inherent weakness associated
              with these fragmented electricity organizations with overlapping
              and duplication of works, merger of this individual organisation
              became necessary to achieve efficiency and reliable service. The
              primary objective of NEA is to generate, transmit and distribute
              adequate, reliable and affordable power by planning, constructing,
              operating and maintaining all generation, transmission and
              distribution facilities in Nepal's power system both
              interconnected and isolated.
